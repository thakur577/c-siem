Reconnaissance techniques are often the initial steps in the cyber attack lifecycle, where threat actors seek to gain knowledge that helps them plan and execute further stages of the attack. This tactic focuses on understanding the target environment, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and selecting the most effective attack vectors.",

Active scanning is often a critical step in the reconnaissance phase of an attack, where adversaries seek to identify potential entry points and vulnerabilities for exploitation."
